Summary of Key Gaps and Fixes
Your router mostly implements the PUT, GET, and DELETE for paths under /files/..., but it differs from the SharedFolderHTTPAuth spec in two main ways:

No explicit “.success” endpoints – the client polls GET /files/<key>.success to detect completion, but your code instead inspects key.includes('success'), which won’t match <key>.success URLs directly.

Missing raw‐bytes handling – for binary uploads (model files) you need express.raw() middleware and must return the raw Buffer body rather than req.body as JSON.

You should add dedicated routes for <key>.success, return proper HTTP 200/404 on those, and ensure the router matches the exact URL patterns the client uses.

1. Routing and Wildcards
Wildcard param :key(*) lets you capture everything (including slashes) after the prefix. This aligns with SharedFolderHTTPAuth’s expectation that <key> may contain / segments. 
Express

In your PUT/GET/DELETE under /files/keras/:committerAddress/:key(*), you correctly map key to e.g. keras/<node_id>/metrics_…

Missing GET /files/<key>.success: the client polls this exact URL to check flags. You need an explicit route like:

js
Copy
Edit
sharedFolderRouter.get('/files/keras/:committerAddress/:key.success', …)
returning 200 if flag exists, 404 otherwise.

2. Success‐Flag Endpoints
The class uses these methods:

python
Copy
Edit
_exists_success_flag(key): GET /files/<key>.success → 200 or 404
_put_success_flag(key): PUT /files/<key>.success → 200
_delete_success_flag(key): DELETE /files/<key>.success
You must mirror each in Express, not rely on substring checks. For example:

js
Copy
Edit
// Check flag
sharedFolderRouter.get('/files/:fullKey.success', …)

// Create flag
sharedFolderRouter.put('/files/:fullKey.success', …)

// Delete flag
sharedFolderRouter.delete('/files/:fullKey.success', …)
This ensures the client’s polling logic works as intended 
MDN Web Docs
.

3. Binary vs JSON Body Parsing
Binary uploads (model .pkl or .h5) must use express.raw({ type: 'application/octet-stream', limit: '100mb' }) before your PUT handlers. Otherwise req.body is parsed as JSON, corrupting the bytes. 
MDN Web Docs

For JSON metrics, continue using express.json().

4. Prisma Array Updates with set
You use:

js
Copy
Edit
[fieldName]: {
  set: folder[fieldName].map((item, idx) =>
    key.includes(`_${idx.toString().padStart(5, '0')}.json`) ? req.body : item
  )
}
That’s correct: Prisma’s set operator replaces the entire array field 
Prisma
.

The .padStart(5, '0') ensures you match exactly 00000…00005 with leading zeros in your filenames

.

5. Upsert vs Two-Step Find/Create
Rather than findFirst() → create() if missing, you can use upsert to merge those into one atomic operation and avoid race conditions:

js
Copy
Edit
await prisma.sharedFolderFile.upsert({
  where: { branchId_committerAddress: { branchId, committerAddress } },
  update: { /* no-op or init arrays */ },
  create: { branchId, committerAddress, metrics_before_aggregation: [], metrics_after_aggregation: [] },
});
This simplifies your logic and prevents duplicate records.

6. DELETE Routes
Your DELETE handlers for both metrics (/files/keras/.../:key(*)) and model (/files/:committerAddress(*)) look good, but ensure they also delete corresponding .success flags via an extra delete on <key>.success.

Checklist of Missing or Adjusted Parts
Add explicit success‐flag routes: GET, PUT, DELETE /files/<key>.success.

Use express.raw() for binary PUTs to /files/:committerAddress.

Upsert instead of find+create.

Ensure model GET route does not conflate committerAddress with key–style param. Consider /files/model/:committerAddress or include :key(*).

Return proper HTTP codes (200/404/204) with no body for flag checks.

With these tweaks, your router will fully satisfy the SharedFolderHTTPAuth contract and integrate seamlessly with flwr_serverless.
