# 🚀 Flair – Privacy-Preserving ML Collaboration

Train machine learning models together without ever sharing your private data.

## 🔒 Why Flair?

Flair is built for privacy—you train models on your device and never expose your raw data. Unlike other collaborative ML platforms, Flair guarantees:

- ✅ **Your Data Stays Private**  
  Models train on your device; only parameter updates (not the data) are shared.

- ✅ **Verifiable Training**  
  Every update is accompanied by a Zero‑Knowledge Proof, so others can confirm the work without seeing your data.

- ✅ **Full Ownership**  
  Each commit is minted as an NFT on Solana, providing immutable proof of your contribution.

- ✅ **Access Control**  
  Only authorized collaborators can view model metadata and updates.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Upload a Model**  
   Create a new ML model repository.

2. **Invite Collaborators**  
   Just like GitHub, invite trusted teammates.

3. **Train Locally**  
   The model is shipped to each device—your data never leaves.

4. **Share Updates, Not Data**  
   You only push gradient or weight updates back to the repo.

5. **Verify with ZK Proofs**  
   Each update is paired with a Zero‑Knowledge Proof for authenticity.

6. **Own Your Work**  
   Finalized updates are stored as NFTs on Solana, cementing your intellectual property.

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Create a new repository  
2. Push an untrained model  
3. Invite collaborators  
4. Collaborators train locally  
5. Push updates (not data!)  
6. Verify & merge contributions  
7. Mint your commit updates as NFTs

## 🔐 Zero‑Knowledge Proofs – Training Verified, Data Hidden 🛡️

A Zero‑Knowledge Proof (ZKP) lets contributors prove they’ve properly trained a model on private data without revealing the data itself.

- ✅ **Proof of Authenticity** – Verifies updates without exposing training data.  
- ✅ **Fraud Prevention** – Ensures real, verifiable contributions.  
- ✅ **Privacy First** – Keeps all the training data strictly confidential.
